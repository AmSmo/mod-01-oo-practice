# Part One - Intro to OO
Classes look good! You started to work in run.rb and maybe removed some code but you can always leave that in so we can look at it too - the way you create instances and interact with them. 
The deliverables for these practices will always be the baseline - if you want to level it up, go for it! 

# Part Two - More to OO

- Your greet makes me chuckle a lot. It's wonderful. Only improvement - indent the lines in your case (the whens and else)
- In `doctor.rb` it's standard to have the attr's and class variables at the top followed by the initialize, then all of your methods. The reason is for easy readability of the core structure of the class/blueprint. 
- For `find_by_speciality`: Great use of downcase to handle the case sensitivity, and I did want a list of the doctor instances so you're good! 
- In `patient.rb`, I didn't even realize it was a pun till rn. For the return, the order does matter. Try putting the return first and seeing what happens. One thing with ruby is that you don't have to write the return; it will automatically return the last statement. When you get to JS you'll be challenged again about implicit v explicit returns but jump that hurdle when you get there :)
